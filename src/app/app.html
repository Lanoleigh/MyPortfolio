                <p>I recently completed a 3 year degree in Computer and Information Science in Application Development.
                   However I have been doing IT since Highschool grade 10. I acheived numberous distinctions throughout my 
                   varsity tenure, to name a few: </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>~ Programming (from 1st year to 3rd)</li>
                  <li>~ Information Systems (IT Project Management)</li>
                  <li>~ Cloud Development</li>

              <p>
                I grew up believing I would make a career out of one of the sports I was good at, as soon as that dream ended another one blossomed. 
                Building meaningful, purposeful software.However I do believe that the competitive nature of the sports I participated in did instil the competitive nature within myself against myself.
                That could be a reason I believe in the Japanese word "Kaizen", which means improvement.
                 Always striving to do better in a personal and professional capacity.
